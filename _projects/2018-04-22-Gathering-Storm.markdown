### A Heroes of Might and Magic inspired game
Our final game took inspiration from heroes of might and magic's mechanics with a War theme. The game is 2 player but on LAN with both players connecting to a server.

Each player gets assigned a team and they take it in turn to move their units. The aim of the game is to wipe out the opposing team with your units. There are various units each with their own stats and attack ranges. For example the sniper can shoot over a long range but has low action points at two per turn. Each units have their own unique amount of action points which they are allotted to spend per turn. Movement costs one point and attacking costs two.
