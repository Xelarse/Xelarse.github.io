### Plant Generation!
For the first task of Advanced Technology I've been asked to create a plant generator using DirectX 11!

The program has the ability to customise the flowers appearance using an ImGui interface and the capability to export to OBJ and MTL for using in other software.

To have an in depth look at the project visit my post mortem [Here](/blog/advanced%20technology/directx%2011/plant%20generation/DirectX-Postmortem)

If you'd like to try out the program feel free to ask at: Alexander2.Allman@live.uwe.ac.uk
