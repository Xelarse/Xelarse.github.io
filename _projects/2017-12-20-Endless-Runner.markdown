### Endless runner with Procedural generation

The second assignment received was to develop a game which cycled endlessly, using Procedural generation to keep the map layout varied and that had a leader board system.

With this brief I wanted to make the art style much softer on the eye this time around so I made some more cartoonish assets to go along with the primitives that I would be using as the main game objects. I opted for simple controls which just involves pressing space to avoid the on coming blocks.

If you want to have a build to play yourself get it touch at: Alexander2.Allman@live.uwe.ac.uk
