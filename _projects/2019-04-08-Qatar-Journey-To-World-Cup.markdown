### Journey to the World Cup!
Qatar will be the home of the World Cup in 2020. In this game you and three other friends will be competing to get all the keys from each Mini-Game and make it to the World Cup in the center of the map first. Whilst exploring the map learn about the Landmarks, History and culture of Qatar in this Mario party esq game.

Careful though, some of the tiles can hurt you just as much as they can help!

To have an in depth look at the project visit my post mortem [Here](/blog/internship/mobile%20pie/Journey-To-The-World-Cup-Post-Mortem)
