### Snake based game

For our first assignment we were proposed to make snake but with a twist. The twists I chose to implement was that the snake also grows in width as well as length as the game progresses. I also made the snake progressively move faster the longer the game went on.

I decided to do this to keep the player more engaged as the simple game of snake can get quite boring after playing for a while and a change in how the game is played, in real time keeps things fresh.

If you want to have a build to play yourself get it touch at: Alexander2.Allman@live.uwe.ac.uk
