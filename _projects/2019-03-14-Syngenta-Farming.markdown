### Farming has evolved with the times!
As technology has developed over time, so have the techniques used in farming. Instead of driving a tractor through a field to collect the fully grown wheat; programmable tractors have been developed to do it for the farmer.

This small web game was created to be a part of a larger projected Syngenta put forwards in order to teach children about the agricultural industry and how its developed over time.

To have an in depth look at the project visit my post mortem [Here](/blog/internship/mobile%20pie/Syngenta-Farm-Game-Post-Mortem)
