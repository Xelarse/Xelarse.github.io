### Level generation!
For the second task of Advanced Technology I've been asked to create a level generator utlising machine learning.

This project has the ability to take a satellite image and output a JSON file with co-ordinates and their related classification. The Unity side of this project then takes the JSON file and builds a level from it.

To have an in depth look at the project visit my post mortem [Here](/blog/advanced%20technology/tensorflow/keras/python/Machine-Learning-Postmortem)
