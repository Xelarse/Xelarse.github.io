### Birdman inspired platformer
The third assignment was to make a game taking inspiration from the film birdman. In our group we decided to take the main inspiration from how the main character phases between the real world and his imagination.

In our platformer the player can switch between a dream world and real world freely. In each of these worlds there are different platforms for the player to navigate. The faster the player can get to the L shaped blocks in all 3 levels gets the high score saved forever on the main menu.
