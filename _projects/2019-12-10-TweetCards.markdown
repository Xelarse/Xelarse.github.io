### Custom Twitter Timelines!
For Mobile Applications I was tasked to make any app of my choice. To take a break from games development I decided to make an app utilising Twitters API.

In this app the user can create "Cards" which are built up from specified Twitter handles; Allowing the user to create custom Twitter timelines without requiring multiple accounts.

To have an in depth look at the project visit my post mortem [Here](/blog/mobile%20applications/xcode/twitter%20rest%20api/TweetCards-Postmortem)

If you'd like to see the app in action check out the user testing video below:
