### Returning back for the Witchball tournament!
Returning back as a member of the Cackles academy it's your job with the help of some familiar faces to play in a Witch ball tournament. Once you arrive however, you're met with a twist and it's up to you to discover the truth whilst competing to win the Witchball Cup!

Collect clues, solve puzzles and compete in the Witchball tournament to see all there is to see at Pentangles academy!
