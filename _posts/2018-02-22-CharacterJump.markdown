## Clouds jumpin!

Learning from my past implementation in infinite runner I plan to make a much more versatile and robust jumping mechanic.

### Velocity is my new best friend
The mistake I made with the previous assignment was due to being pretty na√Øve with the idea of velocity influencing a characters movement. Since I didn't really know this existed I hard coded everything, which made the code very inflexible and have basically no reusability.

However with more experience with Rigidbodies in unity, I brought the same concept to ASGE but instead only in one axis. The was I did the implementation was instead of on the press of space my character moving up and down based of a timer; I have instead based all Y axis movement on a variable y_velocity. When pressing space this increases by a certain amount (currently 50 before tweaking). Then in the players update I move the sprite of the player in the Y axis based off this velocity, which decreases every second by gravity. Then to stop the character going through the ground I have a simple is grounded check to just reset velocity to 0 if grounded.

Here's an example of what it looks like:

At this point collision with blocks isn't implemented just yet but now that the jump is done I can move on!
