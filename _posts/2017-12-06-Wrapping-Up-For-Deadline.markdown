### Presentation breakdown

As the final presentation for our table top game has passed there's a little more to clean up before hand-in.

#### How it went!

Overall the presentation went very well and even though there was a couple of questions asked at the end we explained them very well and took charge of the presentation.

The major criticism that has come from the presentation is that we have tried to focus very hard on the overarching theme to be based on the UK's police force however, we completely missed the fact that from the beginning we have used silhouette's of USA city skylines for our game board. So before submission we will have to change up the design of the board itself. Shown below is an example of the final board with the USA skylines.

#### How the group work went

As a whole I've been happy with the group I've worked with and my contribution to it. Throughout the project I have been a scribe to the group, taking notes of all the progress we've made with timestamps so we can refer to it later after playtests have finished. I have written the rule book for the game and come up with various smaller ideas such as the paper clips to signify training on officer cards. We've all worked pretty hard together though to get all of the required work done for the board game, especially considering we were a smaller group from the beginning. As the deadline is dawning I'm very happy with the enjoyable game we have made which is fun and has a large focus on social interaction
