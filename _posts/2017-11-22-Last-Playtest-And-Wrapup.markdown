## Last playtest and final Tweaks

Wrapping up testing and polishing it up real nice.

### We're almost there!

As the deadline approaches thick and fast we aimed to get another set of games tech students to help play test our game a bit more before we finalise our rules and to get a second opinion on everything we had done up to date.

Thankfully everything went extremely well! In this play testing session we tested our eight county board along side our reduced price for worse stat officers. It's a great feeling to say that it was a great success there was a couple of things mentioned that we could change and I'll go into more detail with those now.

The first major point was hiring and firing in the same turn instead of being able to only choose one of those option per turn. Now we thought about this as not just a group but also along side our play testers and the main reason they felt like a change was necessary was because late game it wasn't worth firing an officer because of the deficit it would put you at for that turn and how it would be a HUGE risk. However at the same time we also didn't think allowing both of these to happen in the same turn would be fair, as someone who is ahead money wise going into the late game could easily snowball their party of officers to completely stomp the competition making it unfair. Currently we decided to keep the game as is as we couldn't decide on a change but if you have any ideas don't be afraid to chuck the suggestion in an email to me!

The second thing which we adapted almost straight away without a second thought was the idea of if two people wanted the same officer that they have a bid off similar to property being mortgaged in monopoly. This was kind of a issue before in which who ever shouted first and loudest got the officer they wanted first. By using bidding it allows both players to see how much they actually value the officer at hand and how much it's worth to them. It makes it much fairer for all players involved and instead of feeling like you lost out because you're not as loud as someone you only lose out if you decide not to out bid them.

Overall this playtest has made me feel very good about finalising the current state at the game and polishing the game pieces itself now as we come quickly to the deadline.
