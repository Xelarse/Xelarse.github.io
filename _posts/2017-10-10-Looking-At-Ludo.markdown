## A throwback to my childhood

I remember many Christmas days playing Ludo with the family getting furious when my sister kept winning. This time we look at the rules to try and make changes for the better instead of the worse.

### Analysing Ludo

Playing Ludo again after such a long time was warming but this time we set out minds to taking a more analytical approach with the game rather than playing it for fun.

Looking at the game we initially found the idea of having to roll a 6 to release your pawns extremely irritating. So we very hastily changed that so you can roll anything to release a pawn but you choose to either move a new pawn out or move an old one that was previously on the board. This made the game a heck of a lot more fun because you'd often get stuck in the spawn point trying to get out when you couldn't because you didn't roll that 1 in 6 chance.

We also added points on the board in which if you land on them you roll the d6 again and can choose to move someone else's counter forwards or backwards. This turned into some funny situations where people would often move someone else's counter forwards just to take another players counter out of the game and send it back to spawn.

Overall this session was quite fruitful because we learned how much small changes can make a big difference in developing and iterating games and also how to iterate through changes quickly in order to test things quickly.
