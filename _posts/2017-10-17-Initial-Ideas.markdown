## Spitballing Ideas

Before we make a table top game we need ideas first!

### Filtering the list
Firstly we made a large list of various topics that our game could be based on from more controversial topics such Trump and his presidency all the way to social media outlets spreading misinformation an example of a tweet of this from a couple of years ago below:

From filtering this list and looking at which ones are appropriate we came to a decision to two different ideas.

### The two ideas
The two ideas we finally decided to prototype was a bitcoin game in which you have to invest in various crypto currencies in order to make the money to afford a bitcoin. We decided this because crypto currency is very large right now and growing at a rapid pace, increase in value exponentially in the last few years.

The second idea is based of the police force and having to deal with various cuts to their sector. This means that in result officers have been spread thin across various counties and therefore need more precise management and choice in where to invest them. Due to this we were thinking about making a police management game in which you control police officers and send them to various areas to solve crisis'.
