### The Worst Witch of them all!

To get myself settled into the team and acquainted with a new engine I've been tasked to do some level design for the upcoming expansion to the BBC game Worst Witch Magical Mystery.

#### How did it go?
It was extremely fun! Being free to be able to make my own stamp on a game that lots of people will experience was liberating. Overall on this project I got to design some environments / areas using existing assets, various puzzles using existing designed mechanics and designing and developing a full Mini-game thats used in the game. It was a huge confidence boost that I was quickly trusted with increasing responsibility and seeing various things that I had designed and prototyped being accepted. Even though at times there was a couple a criticisms, I took them on board fast and reiterated my previous designs.

Here are a couple of examples of the environments I designed:
{% include flexslider-general.html imageUrls=page.environmentCarousel.urls imageCaptions=page.environmentCarousel.captions %}

Next a couple of examples of the puzzles I designed:
{% include flexslider-general.html imageUrls=page.puzzleCarousel.urls imageCaptions=page.puzzleCarousel.captions %}

Finally a quick example of how the minigame I designed plays:
{% include flexslider-general.html imageUrls=page.minigameCarousel.urls imageCaptions=page.minigameCarousel.captions %}

#### What could go better next time?
Even though the task went extremely well there was a couple of my designs that needed to be reworked. This was mainly due to miscommunication and misunderstanding as I would go and design a plan for a new puzzle or new way of interacting with the minigame but since that didn't fit with the current idea of how it was being implemented; mainly due to that information not being relayed before hand, it resulted in reworking ideas and wasting some time. Although this was the case all in all not much time was wasted and the project was very fruitful and a perfect jumping off point into the company.
