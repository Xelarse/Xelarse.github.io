## If portal taught me anything

Is that how important testing is!

### Group meetup!
Following our presentation we have played around with a lot of new ideas and seen how they could fit into our game or in a fair few cases how they didn't. We also had to decide how we wanted our game to play with only two players instead of the four because this was one of our assignment specifications.

Our first major idea which we are at this point setting in stone is the idea of being able to train officers. So instead of just being able to hire new officers into your hand you can also buff the ones you already own in order to have a larger impact. Currently we have it so that you lose the officer for that turn you train them and you won't be able to use them for that turn whilst they are being trained. This currently has a 5K cost assigned with it and that cost increases by 5K for each successive time you train that officer. I personally really like the idea of training officers but our system right now falls a bit flat mainly because the sacrifice of losing an officer for a turn means a huge amount and people prefer to save up for another officer instead of training one they already own. I put forward that we could try tweaking this system so that maybe you don't lose the officer for that turn but you can only train one officer per turn. This way you can still train your officers but not have to take the huge penalty of losing them for that turn. This is something we will have to playtest.

Our next major idea was splitting the turn up into three segments. The first is the Hire/Fire/Training phase, this is pretty self explanatory in this phase you can only either hire a new officer, fire one to make space for another or train one of your officers. Following this phase is Events(previously called crisis') phase. In this phase the die gets rolled and events get place on to the board depending on the number rolled on the die. Due to balancing problems we also decided that you can only have a max of 2 events per county(previously called districts). In this phase players communicate with each other to decide which events they are going to resolve and whether or not they will work together. The final phase is the resolution phase. In this phase all event resolutions are finalised and the extra funding and event cards gained for resolving these events are then distributed to the appropriate players.

Another small idea that has a large impact on the way you play is how you hire officers. Previously we had it so that you could just hire anyone from the deck. This however lead to everyone just saving up for the best officers then buying, leaving 70% of the deck unused. Instead we switched to a system in which the top three officers are over turned and you can choose to hire from one of those three. If you don't like those however you can pay 5K to reroll the three officers. This allowed more of the cheaper cards to be used and also more use of the fire mechanic which is a large investment because you'll be down an officer for a turn but worth it in the long run if you get a better replacement.

Finally our last major idea was giving a punishment for going into debt. In the game if you can't solve events in your or neighbouring unowned county's then you lose funds as a sort of punishment. However people being able to endlessly go into debt really defeated the point of it being there. So we have made a rule so that if your in debt for three turns then your out of the game. Currently through out playtests this hasn't been too harsh of a punishment and still hasn't happened yet but its a mechanic there for players to not act recklessly with their funds.

Some smaller tweaks included:
  - Once a player of the game gets five and ten event cards for the first time we increase the number of events placed per turn.
  - Given a max amount of officers a player can have, currently of which is five.
  - If your initial hand is under a stat total you can reroll your hand (still working out at which point is too low and a reroll is allowed).
  - Allowing players to hire a 6th temporary officer as a sort of contractor and you have to pay their yearly salary per turn instead of a one off(helps later on but might be slightly too strong needs more testing).

We also made progress on our two player board but I will make a continuation of this post because this ones already getting a tad long. Overall though I feel that the playtesting is paying off and our game is beginning to feel much more refined.
