## Finally getting some outside opinions!

After getting our game to a pretty good point we ask a couple of fellow course mates to give their opinion on our game.

### A lot of good ideas were thrown around!

Playtesting the game with a couple fresh pair of eyes on the game proved to be very useful, especially considering that they are also on the Games technology course also. This meant that instead of saying things were just good or bad we had more constructive criticism with extra ideas that could help to solve some of the problems they thought we had.

We took a Directed/involved approach to our play test. In which I myself was a sort of scribe of the session and two of my fellow group members play the game along with another two members off the course. We chose to do our session this way mainly because we didn't have a rule book finalised at this point so it would've been hard to just explain the game to them straight away and let them play but rather explain how the game works as we played. As they played I jotted down any thoughts or criticisms that the play testers had and started to elaborate on them to see if I could think of any suggestions to fix these problems before we discussed them in more detail after the playtest.

One of the larger issues we came across in the play test was how our players teamed up but how this also cut interaction between all players.

To elaborate on the previous statement because county one and two are both connected to five and every turn events get placed on five and six; county one and two tended to team up together. This also happened in the same way with counties three and four. We thought this to be good at first because people almost had little teams which were formed during gameplay and the social interaction between the teams was very enjoyable to be a part of. However at the same time this also almost forced the same two teams every single time due to the placements of the counties. After discussing the problem we thought of adding an extra two counties to the other sides of the board and alternate which ones always get the two events at the beginning of the event phase. This way there's still teams but it removes that predictability of who is going to team with who. Although this is very early on idea and still needs testing. By doing this we would also need to up our die from a D6 to a D8 which is generally less commonly owned and less accessible on its own.

Another major issue was how event cards and officer cards lined up with each other. The issue was mainly with events that due to the random nature we took to making them had some really unfair situations where you would have to invest all your officers into an event that didn't particularly feel rewarding for doing so. For example this issue sprung up when an event was placed onto the board that only required one strength and intelligence but twelve dexterity. Due to the extremely high dexterity stat it meant you had to invest all your officers into it but only for one stat, which made it feel like the other stats were being wasted. The currently plan to solve this is to get the averages of all the officers we have for each stat and then tweak the cards we feel are unfair to slightly fit more with the averages of the officers and also have a more even spread of stats overall. Similarly to before though this still needs to be implemented and play tested.

A couple of smaller ideas that need to be discussed and play tested to check for validity for our game:
- Making worse units cheaper so that they can be more of a quick investment that can be disposed of later but doesn't hit the bank to hard.
- Making punishments for not completing events larger so that people don't snowball to hard with their funds.
- Looking at changing it to a turn based game in a sense where each player takes their turn and says their move rather than everyone deciding at the same time (I personally dislike this because it harms the social interaction and increases phase times dramatically)
