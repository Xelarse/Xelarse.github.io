### Farewell Mobile Pie

After an awesome year internship with Mobile Pie I have a bit of time to reflect on how it went.

#### The Experience
Even though I've studied Games Development for the past two years at University; working full time on games came with a slight learning curve. 

The first major part to get used to, which definitely ended up being the best part was working daily with a team. Although I've had experience working with a team before in previous jobs; the majority of my university work has been done solo, even if it was supposed to be done as a team due to some unreliable teammates. This was a breath of fresh air! Having people I was able to frequently ask questions to and share workloads with was a godsend. Through this I also became acquainted with the dynamic of being a Gameplay Developer; mainly in terms of being the middle man for the a project. I was frequently back and forth with the in-house artist when new assets were needed and when new ones were created to be put into the game. I also used asset lists for sound files that were put in the game given to us from the freelance sound designer.

The second major part was refining my time management. Throughout the placement I had to work to sprint deadlines and delivering frequent builds to the clients; so they can see the current progress of the project I was working on at the time. In conjunction with this I also used Pivotal tracker to keep track of things that needed changing on the project and a history of things that had been done. This development on my time management skills will help massively in my final year of university and further on in my career.

The final part was giving me the confidence in my abilities. Starting work at a company who are in full swing with multiple projects, it's easy feel completely out of your depth. Before working at Mobile Pie I had never coded in Javascript nor had to optimise any of my projects to the degree I had to at Mobile Pie due to projects either being web games or mobile games. After working at Mobile Pie I have gained the confidence in my abilities, learned a new programming language from scratch and also largely improved my debugging techniques to discover things that are hurting performance. All of this will help me moving forwards onto my careers after university.

#### The Goodbyes
One of the worst parts of ending the placement was having the leave all the friends I had made on placement. Even though it was only a year; a couple of new members were added to the Mobile Pie team at the same time, meaning that, a bunch of us got really close. Even though my final year of university is going to be very busy I definitely plan to arrange catch ups and keep in touch on slack.

All in all the placement was great experience, I want to give a huge thanks to Richard Wilson for giving me the opportunity and an equally huge thanks to the Mobile Pie team for being so welcoming and such a joy to work with.
