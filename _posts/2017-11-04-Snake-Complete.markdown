## A little bit of polish

Since the last post I have refactored a lot of code, Added the game over state and snake thickness feature and overall just wrapped it up ready for submission.

### How does it look?
Overall I'm extremely happy with the final design, the game plays as intended and I have yet to find any more game breaking bugs through playtesting. Here's some screen caps of the game and some the final look at a simplified version of my class structure UML.

Here's an example of the snake growing in width when hitting a certain amount of food eaten:

Here's the UML to show class structure but not including functions and variables:
