## The police it is!

After looking at both of our final ideas we decided on one!

### Both concepts battle it out!
After sitting down and coming up with ideas for both the police concept and the cryptocurrency concept we ended up deciding on the police game. This was due to a few reasons.

#### Why cryptocurrency fell flat
Our idea for the cryptocurrency game was essentially a circular board split into segments which you travel around via the roll of a die. You start off with initial funds and to make money throughout the game you would have to invest in various cryptocurrency and essentially manipulate stocks to get enough money to buy a bitcoin.

Here was an initial concept of the board and placements:

Whilst playing the game as you landed on specific squares you would draw a stocks card. These cards would vary the value one of the many cryptocurrency's in the game. The idea was to invest money when the stocks were low and hope that they increased quickly for a fast return.

This however felt really poor for the player because there was too many variables out of the control of the player to allow for strategic play. This is why we added a "Play's Deck". The idea of this deck was that you get a hand of cards that affect the stocks an extremely large amount especially in comparison to the stocks deck. This allowed players to manipulate the stocks in a much more significant manner and adding the idea of bluffing because you wouldn't want to necessarily invest into a stock that you would increase by 20% the next turn because every would see that and invest too.

Here is an initial concept of the table of stocks and how it can be shown how the various stocks can be affected:

In the end we decided against the game because in our eyes it felt too much like monopoly with a gimmick rather than its own fully fledged game and at the same time it would hurt our scope of audience massively because cryptocurrency still isn't very know by many of people.

#### Why we fell in love with the police concept
Our idea for the police was mainly based around management of various officers and spending resources wisely. This was due to all the recent cuts with police officers and how they have to spread their force very thinly and prioritise the correct events at the correct time. From taking inspiration from munchkins we based our game around each player owning their own area on the board and having to defend their district from any crisis. However, you are also connected to the other players of the game and can choose to appoint officers to districts adjacent to your own. This brings a massive reliance on other players due to some events being near impossible to solve alone and through this reliance brings a very interesting social interaction between players. Do players help each other out and win together or back stab one another to gain an upper hand against opposing districts. This is why we fell in love with the police concept; purely because of the social interactions that can arise from it and how much it can vary from game to game and depending on who your playing with/against.

Here is a picture taken from the playtest of the game:

As you can see from the picture about there are various crisis' on the districts of the board. The player on district 3 right now not only has to deal with the crisis in his home town district but also on the neighbouring district to the south. You can also see the players officers to the bottom left of the picture with their stats. When going to complete a crisis you need to match or overcome the stat requirements with your various officers.

So in the end we decided on the police game purely because whilst play testing we had a lot of enjoyment from playing it and police would be much more relatable to the masses in contrast to a cryptocurrency based game.
