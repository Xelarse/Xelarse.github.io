## Two player testing!

Testing the two player board and rules to see if they're up to scratch

### Changes we've made
For the two player game board we've decided to cut off the external counties and just chose to have the centre four but also connect them diagonally. By doing this the two players who are play are not only connected to two counties that are unowned, but they are also connected to each other, allowing for all the social interaction as the four player version of the game but on a smaller scale. Other than the board being different the basic rules and setup of the game is pretty much exactly the same bar the event placements. When on the event phase, the number of starting events is halved so instead of beginning with four events the game starts with two. Also to match the board itself instead of rolling a D6 to decide where events will be placed in the two player version of the game you play with a D4.

Below is an initial concept of what the two player board will look like:
